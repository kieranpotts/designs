= System design template

== Steps

=== Step 1: Clarify requirements

Define the *use cases* and *constraints* of the system as functional and
non-functional requirements.

==== Functional requirements

* What are the core features that the system should support?

* Who are the users, eg. customers, internal teams, administrators, etc.?

* How will users interact with the system, eg. web, mobile, API, etc.?

* What are the key data types the system must handle, eg. text, images,
  structured data, etc.?

* Are there any external systems or third-party services the system needs to
  integrate with?

==== Non-functional requirements

* Is the system read-heavy or write-heavy? What's the read-to-write ratio?

* Can the system have some downtime, or does it need to be highly available?

* How critical is data consistency?

* Are there any specific latency requirements?

* Will rate limiting need to be applied to external API requests?

=== Step 2: Capacity estimation

* How many users are expected to interact with the system daily, and monthly?

* What is the maximum number of concurrent users expected during peak times?

* What is the expected number of requests per second?

* How is this broken down between read and write operations?

* How much storage might be needed to store all the data?

* What different types of storage might be needed?

* How much memory might be needed to cache frequently-accessed data?

* Based on estimated traffic volume and data transfer sizes, can you estimate
  network bandwidth requirements?

=== Step 3: Conceptual design

The conceptual architecture is the highest level of abstraction to view the
system. It defines the major components of the system and how they interact.
The purpose of the conceptual design is to determine the subsystems, the
responsibilities of each, and the types of communication required between
the boundaries of the subsystems.

=== Step 4: Physical design

The physical architecture maps the logical architecture to physical devices on
which each software component runs. Simple diagrams should be used to show the
major components of the system, including:

* *Clients*: User-facing interfaces, eg. mobile.

* *Application servers*: To process client requests.

* *Load balancers*: To distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers.

* *Services*: Specialized components performing specific functions.

* *Databases*: To store user information and metadata.

* *Storage*: To store files, images, videos, etc.

* *Caches*: To improve latency and reduce load on the databases.

* *Message queues*: If using asynchronous communication.

* *External services*: If integrating with third-party APIs, eg. payment
  gateways.

Keep it simple. Avoid over-engineering, especially in the high-level designs.

=== Step 5: Database design

This step involves modeling the data, choosing the right storage systems,
designing the database schema, and optimizing the storage and retrieval of data
based on the anticipated access patterns.

==== Data modeling

* Identify the main *data entities* that the system needs to
  store and manage, eg. users, products, orders.

* Consider the *relationships* between these entities (how they interact
  with each other).

* Determine the *attributes* or properties associated with each entity,
  eg. a user has a name, email, and password. Which attributes are required,
  and which are optional? Which can have default values?

* Identify any *unique identifiers* or primary keys for each entity.

* Use *normalization* where it is priority to achieve data integrity and to
  minimize redundancy, and *denormalization* where it is necessary to
  optimize read performance for read-heavy data.

==== Database types

Evaluate the requirements and characteristics of the data to choose the
appropriate storage solution, particularly SQL vs. NoSQL. Consider factors
such as data structure, scalability, performance, consistency, and query
patterns.

* *Relational databases* are suitable for structured data with complex
  relationships and ACID transactions.

* *NoSQL databases* are suitable for unstructured or semi-structured data,
  high scalability, and eventual consistency. Consider specialist forms of
  NoSQL databases, eg. graph databases for highly connected data, or
  time-series databases where the relationship between data points is
  based on time.

Consider using a combination of databases if different data subsets have
distinct requirements.

=== Step 6: API design

Define how different components of the system will interact with each other
(internal APIs), and how external clients can access the system's functionality
(external APIs). There may be entirely different designs for internal and
external APIs.

Consider communication protocols, eg:

* *HTTPS*: Commonly used for RESTful APIs and web services.

* *WebSockets*: For real-time bidirectional communication, eg. chat apps.

* *gRPC*: Efficient for direct RPC-style inter-service communication within
  service-oriented architectures.

* *Messaging protocols*: AMQP or MQTT for asynchronous messaging.

Consider data formats, eg. JSON, XML, Protocol Buffers.

Consider authentication and authorization mechanisms, eg. OAuth, JWT,
API keys.

=== Step 7: Deep dive into key components

For each major component of the system design, identify key challenges likely
to be encountered, such as scalability, availability, resilience (fault
tolerance), data consistency, latency, security, and cost concerns. Identify
single points of failure and potential bottlenecks in the system. Assume
everything will fail at some point, and plan for it.

Next, consider how you might address these challenges. For example, you might
choose to design some redundancy into the system components (eg. in the form
of multiple load balancers and database replicas) to eliminate single points
of failure.

The key areas of the system to dive into are:

* *Services*

  **  For each service, could you add more servers behind a load balancer, to
      handle increased traffic?

  **  Could services be broken down into smaller, more manageable microservices?

  **  Are critical service stateless, so improve their scalability and
      resilience?

* *Processing*

  **  What scope is there to use asynchronous programming models, to handle
      concurrent requests as efficiently as possible? What tasks are appropriate
      for background processing?

  **  What tasks would be suitable for batch processing?

  **  What tasks would require real-time stream processing?

* *Communication*

  **  What are the main modes of communication between services, eg. synchronous
      requests, asynchronous messaging (eg. events), or direct RPC calls? Each
      mode of communication will have its own particular risks that need to be
      identified and mitigates.

  **  Consider how circuit breakers may help to prevent cascading failures, and
      also protect some services from overload.

  **  Consider if implementing heartbeat mechanisms would  be useful to detect
      failures and trigger failover systems?

  **  Could retry mechanisms with exponential backoff be used to handle temporary
      service failures, eg. during system recovery.

  **  Consider how requests could be made idempotent, to simplify retry logic
      and error handling.

* *Databases*

  **  How would you handle a massive increase in data volume?

  **  Consider sharding (splitting data across multiple servers) and replication
      (eg. read and write replicas).

  **  Consider the trade-offs between vertical scaling (increasing the capacity
      of individual resources like CPU, memory, and storage) and horizontal
      scaling (adding more nodes and using load balancers to evenly distribute
      the traffic between the nodes).

  **  How could database queries be optimized, eg. using indexes for faster data
      retrieval, or denormalization to reduce expensive cross-table joins?

* *Caches*

  **  Where could you add caching, for example to reduce latency or reduce
      load on data stores?

  **  Could you implement geographic caching, eg. CDNs, to reduce latency for
      users in different world regions?

  **  How would you implement cache invalidation?

  **  Consider write-through caching strategies for write-heavy operations, and
      read-through caching for read-heavy operations.

  **  Can caches be prepopulated with critical data, to avoid cold starts?

* *API design*

  **  How would you handle versioning of APIs? What strategies would you need in
      place to ensure backwards compatibility is maintained?

  **  Consider appropriate rate limiting strategies for security and resilience.

* *Infrastructure*

  **  Can the system be deployed across different data centers or cloud
      providers to improve availability (localized failures are eliminated as
      a potential single-point-of-failure)?

  **  Consider geographical redundancy to protect against regional failures or
      disasters.

  **  How would you deploy the system? Consider containerization (eg. Docker),
      container orchestration (eg. Kubernetes), and infrastructure as code
      (eg. Terraform).

  **  How would you implement auto-scaling to handle traffic spikes?

  **  How would you monitor the system? Consider logging, metrics, and tracing
      tools.

  **  Consider using a data lake or data warehouse for analytics and reporting.

* *Testing*

  **  Could you implement chaos engineering practices to test resilience and
      find vulnerabilities?

=== Step 8: Document trade-offs

There can be no perfect solution. Identify the trade-offs that have been made
in the system design, and why these are necessary due to the requirements and
constraints. For example:

* *Consistency vs availability*: In distributed systems, there's always a
  trade-off to be made between strong consistency and high availability.

* *Latency vs throughput*: Does the design optimize for low latency or high
  throughput?

* *Storage cost vs retrieval speed*: Is the design optimized for storage cost
  or data retrieval speed? Why is this choice appropriate, given the expected
  access patterns.

* *Development time vs performance*: How does the design find a good balance
  between time-to-market and optimizing for long-term maintainability?
