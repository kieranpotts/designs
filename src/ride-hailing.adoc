== Functional requirements

* Riders can see all the nearby available drivers on a map.

* Riders can book a ride by specifying a pickup location, drop-off location.

* Match riders with nearby available drivers in real-time.

* Real-time estimation of ride cost and time of arrival, based on distance,
  traffic, and demand.

* Real-time tracking of the ride, both for rider and driver.

== Non-functional requirements

* *Scalability*: The system should scale to handle millions of users and
  rides simultaneously.

* Ensure *low latency* for real-time matching, GPS tracking, and ride requests.

* Ensure *high availability* with minimal downtime.

* *Consistency*: The riders and drivers should have a consistent view of the
  system.
