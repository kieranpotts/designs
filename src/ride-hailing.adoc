* Riders can see all the nearby available drivers on a map.

* Riders can book a ride by specifying a pickup location, drop-off location.

* Match riders with nearby available drivers in real-time.

* Real-time estimation of ride cost and time of arrival, based on distance, traffic, and demand.

* Real-time tracking of the ride, both for rider and driver.

=== Non-functional requirements

* Scalability: the system should scale to handle millions of users and rides simultaneously.

* Latency: low latency for real-time matching, GPS tracking, and ride requests.

* Availability: minimize downtime.

* Consistency: riders and drivers should have a consistent view.
