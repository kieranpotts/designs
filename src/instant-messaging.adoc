= Instant messaging service design

// TODO

////

== Functional requirements

* Support one-on-one and group conversations.

* Keep track of the online/offline status of users.

* Provide message delivery statuses (sent, delivered, read).

* Support multimedia messages (images, videos, voice notes, documents).

* Push notifications for new messages, calls, and mentions (optional).

== Non-functional requirements

* *Real-time* message delivery with minimal latency.

* The system should handle millions of concurrent users.

* The system should be highly available. However, the availability can be
  compromised in the interest of consistency.

* Durability (messages shouldn't get lost).
