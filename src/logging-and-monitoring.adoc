= Logging and monitoring service system design

// TODO

////

== Functional requirements

* Collect logs from various sources such as applications, servers, databases,
  and microservices.

* Support for multiple log formats, eg. JSON, plaintext, XMl.

* Archive old logs to cost-effective storage, eg. cloud-based cold storage.

* Provide powerful querying capabilities to filter and search logs based on
  time range, log level, source, and other attributes.

* Set up alerts based on specific log patterns, thresholds, or anomalies.

== Non-functional requirements

* Scalability: The system should scale horizontally to handle increasing
  volumes of logs, metrics, and monitoring data.

* Low latency log ingestion and processing to ensure real-time monitoring.

* High availability to ensure continuous monitoring and alerting.

* Durability: Ensure that log data is stored with high durability, with
  replication across multiple nodes or data centres.
