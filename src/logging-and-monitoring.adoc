= Logging and monitoring service system design

== Requirements

=== Functional requirements

* Collect logs from various sources such as applications, servers, databases, and microservices.

* Support for multiple log formats, eg. JSON, plaintext, XMl.

* Archive old logs to cost-effective storage, eg. cloud-based cold storage.

* Provide powerful querying capabilities to filter and search logs based on time range, log level, source, and other attributes.

* Set up alerts based on specific log patterns, thresholds, or anomalies.

=== Non-functional requirements

* Scalability: the system should scale horizontally to handle increasing volumes of logs, metrics, and monitoring data.

* Latency: log ingestion and processing should have low latency to provide users with real-time monitoring.

* Availability: ensure continuous monitoring and alerting.

* Durability: ensure that log data is stored with high durability.
